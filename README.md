# Level 4 Task 7 -Error handling

## Task

● Create a file called home.html, in which you have an html form that takes a number. 

Create a handling script called maths.php. Create the following functions in it:

○ is_positive() - checks that a number is positive.

○ is_divisible() - checks that a number is divisible by five.

○ enough_digits() - checks that the number has at least 4 digits.

● Each of these functions should not return anything but should throw a custom exception each if their respective condition isn’t met.

● Have one try block and a connected catch block for each of the potential exceptions. Handle each exception by echoing the respective error data in formatted HTML.
